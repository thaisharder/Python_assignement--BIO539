# Goal
This script will calculate the linguistic complexity of a specific string. That can be calculated based on the proportion of k-mers that are observed compared to the total number that are theoretically possible.
To do so, this script has 5 functions:

# sequence_select
This function will read a specific file with an imput filename and, as a result, will creat a string. The file that contains the sequence should be specified here as an argument. 

# Counting_kmers
This function will calculate the occurance of k-mers in a specific sequence (read)

# pdframe_kmers
This function will create a dataframe (similiar to a table) that contains possible k-mers and observed -kmers from a specific sequence.
K_obs = observed kmers
k_pos = possible kmers 
To creat the dataframe, by the end of the function it is necessary to "import panda as pd".

# plots
After generate a dataframe this script will create graphs based on observed k-mers/possible k-mers (y-axes) and a specifi k (x-axes) 

# liguistic_complexity
This function will generate a number that represents the lingusitic complexity, which is the result of the division of "observed kemrs" by "possible kmers" given a specific sequence.
